In Pandas, when you define a function that has IF/ELSE conditions, you have to use apply or lambda

They are not supported in HCL data frame. However, with np.vectorize you can easily use complex functions with HCL data frames

This is an example of how it can be done, and you can use the same function with Pandas and HCL data frames



import numpy as np

#define a function with IF/ELSe

def test1(a,b):
    if a == 25:
        return b
    else:
        return "  "

# use np.vectorize and create a second function
test2 = np.vectorize(test1)

# call the vectorized function passing the arguments
df["New3"] = test2(a=df["Age"], b=df["Name"])
df["New3"] = test2(df["Age"], df["Name"])
df.head()
